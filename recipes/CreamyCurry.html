    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
      <h3>Dough</h3>
      <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons ice water</li>
      <h3>Filling</h3>
      <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cubed</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
      <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain whole milk yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tart apple, cored and chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>For dough, add flour, curry powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until combined. Add shortening and cold butter. Pulse until combined and mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition, until mixture comes together (See Note). Wrap in plastic and chill until ready to use, or up to 24 hours.</li>
      <li>For filling, melt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, onion, celery, carrots, and curry powder; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest parts of chicken should register 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Reduce heat to medium; add flour and cook, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes more. Slowly stir in broth and yogurt; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in apple, cilantro, salt, pepper, and thyme.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>To assemble pie, lightly flour a surface, unwrap dough, and roll out to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out shapes from dough with 2 1/2- to 3-inch cookie cutters. Arrange shapes on top of filling, overlapping as needed to cover. Brush egg over dough shapes.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with additional cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
